# Generate coordinates of the modified sections

To generate the cross-sections of the snake (with both lips, only the front lip,
only the back lip, and no lips), run the script `create_modified_sections.py`
located in the folder `scripts`.

```shell
python scripts/create_modified_sections.py
```

The geometries will be saved into text files in the present directory.
