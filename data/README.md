To generate the cross-sections of the snake (with both lips, only the front lip,
only the back lip, and no lips), run the script `createModifiedSnakes.py`
located in the folder `scripts`.

```
python scripts/createModifiedSnakes.py
```

The geometries will be saved into files in the present directory.
