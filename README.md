**A two-dimensional numerical investigation to quantify the role of the lips of a gliding-snake cross-section in the lift generation**

The snake, *Chrysopelea paradisi*, has the ability to jump from tree branches and glide over several dozens of meters, undulating laterally by sending head-to-tail waves.
When gliding, part of the S-shaped body are perpendicular to the direction of motion and can be approximated as cylinder of constant cross-section.

On the ground, the snake possesses an approximately circular cross-section.
However, when gliding, the snake reshapes its cross-section by expanding its rib-cage, which leads to the formation of lips.

As the gliding body resembles a succession of connected cylinders with this unconventional cross-section, it seems legitimate to assume that those cylinders greatly contribute in the lift generation.

Therefore, we aim to investigate the lift generated by the snake cross-section by means of two-dimensional numerical simulations.
Specifically, we are interested in quantifying the role of the protuberant lips.
For that purpose, we use our in-house software, [PetIBM](https://github.com/barbagroup/PetIBM), that solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with an immersed-boundary method.

The original geometry of the body cross-section of the snake *Chrysopelea paradisi* is available on [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/Body_cross_section_of_the_flying_snake_Chrysopelea_paradisi/705877):

We use and modify this geometry to compute the flow around several cross-sections (with both lips and missing one or both lips) for different Reynolds numbers and various angles of attack.
